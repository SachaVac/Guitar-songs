  <h1>The Beatles - Norwegian wood</h1>
    <pre>
        [Version 1]
        E                                  D       A   E
        I once had a girl or should I say she once had me
        E                                    D      A    E
        she showed me her room isn't it good Norwegian wood
            Emi                                          A
        she asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
            Emi                                          F#mi H
        so I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

        [Version 2]    
           E                             D         A   E
        I sat on a rug biding my time drinking her wine
        E                                       D         A     E
        we talked until two and then she said: "It's time for bed"
            Emi                                              A
        she told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
        Emi                                               F#mi H
        I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

        [Version 3]
           E                           D       A   E
        And when I awoke I was alone this bird had flown
                                      D       A   E
        so I lit a fire isn't it good Norwegian wood?
