    Ami       C         D           F
    There is a house in New Orleans 
    Ami       C          E
    They call the Rising Sun
    Ami               C       D           F
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Ami       E        Ami 
    And God I know I'm one  
    
    
    Ami       C         D        F
    My mother was a tailor
    Ami       C         E
    Sewed my new blue jeans
    Ami       C         D        F
    My father was gamblin' man
    Ami       E         Ami
    Down in New Orleans
    
    
    Ami           C           D         F
    Now the only thing a gambler needs
    Ami           C           E
    Is a suitcase and a trunk
    Ami           C           D         F
    And the only time he'll be satisfied
    Ami           E        Ami
    Is when he's all a-drunk

    Oh mother, tell your children
    Not to do what I have done
    Spend your lives in sin and misery
    In the house of the Rising Sun
    
    
    Well I've got one foot on the platform
    The other foot on the train
    I'm going back to New Orleans
    To wear that ball and chain
    
    
    Well there is a house in New Orleans
    They call the Rising Sun
    And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    And God I know I'm one
