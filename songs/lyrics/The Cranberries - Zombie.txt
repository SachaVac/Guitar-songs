[Verse 1]  
        Emi          C  
Another head hangs lowly,  
        G               D  
Child is slowly taken.  
       Emi              C  
And the violence caused such silence,  
       G              D  
Who are we mistaken?  

        Emi                       C  
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family.  
       G                            D  
In your head, in your head they are fighting,  
          Emi                       
With their tanks and their bombs,  
         C  
And their bombs and their guns.  
         G                              D  
In your head, in your head, they are crying...  

[Chorus]  
        Emi          C  
In your head, in your head,  
       G              D  
Zombie, zombie, zombie,  
                            Emi  
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head,  
        C  
In your head,  
       G               D  
Zombie, zombie, zombie?  

(Emi, C, G, D) 2x  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, dou, dou, dou, dou, dou...  

[Verse 2]  
        Emi          C  
Another mother's breakin',  
       G                D  
Heart is taking over.  
       Emi                 C  
When the violence causes silence,  
       G              D  
We must be mistaken.  

        Emi                   C  
It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen.  
        G                                    D  
In your head, in your head they're still fighting,  
         Emi  
With their tanks and their bombs,  
           C  
And their bombs and their guns.  
         G                          D  
In your head, in your head, they are dying...  

[Chorus]  
       Emi           C  
In your head, in your head,  
       G                 D  
Zombie, zombie, zombie,  
                            Emi  
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head,  
       C  
In your head,  
       G                  D  
Zombie, zombie, zombie?  

(Emi, C, G, D) 2x  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-a...
