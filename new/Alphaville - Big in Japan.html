[Intro]
| Dm   | Bb   | C    | A    | x2

[Verse 1]
       Dm
Winter cityside
          Bb                          C                            A
Crystal bits of snowflakes all around my head and in the wind
       Dm
I had no illusions
           Bb                     C                                 A
That I'd ever find a glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
       Dm          Bb              C           Am        Bb
You did what you did to me, now it's history I see
             Gm              A
Here's my comeback on the road again

[Pre-Chorus]
      Dm             Bb                C
Things will happen while they can
          Am               Bb                Gm               A
I will wait here for my man tonight, it's easy when you're big in Japan

[Chorus]
                          Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
          C       Am              Bb           Gm             A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
          Dm     Bb               C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
            Bb               Gm       A                            Dm
Things are easy when you're big in Japan, oh when you're big in Japan

[Instrumental]
|(Dm) Bb | C  Am | Bb Gm | A     | x2

[Verse 2]
        Dm
Neon on my naked skin
           Bb                        C                          A
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
         Dm                         Bb
Shall I stay here at the zoo
                                   C                          A
Or should I go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes
       Dm          Bb              C            Am       Bb   Gm   A
You did what you did to me, now it's history IIIIIIIIIIIII see

[Pre-Chorus]
      Dm             Bb                C
Things will happen while they can
          Am               Bb                Gm               A
I will wait here for my man tonight, it's easy when you're big in Japan

[Chorus]
                          Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
          C       Am              Bb           Gm             A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
          Dm     Bb               C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
            Bb               Gm       A
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

                          Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
          C       Am               Bb           Gm             A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
          Dm     Bb               C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
            Bb               Gm       A                            Dm
Things are easy when you're big in Japan, oh when you're big in Japan

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
                          Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
          C       Am              Bb           Gm               A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
          Dm     Bb               C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
            Bb               Gm       A
Things are easy when you're big in Japan

                          Dm     Bb
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
          C       Am              Bb           Gm               A
Big in Japan, be tight, big in Japan, ooh the eastern sea's so blue
          Dm     Bb               C                  Am
Big in Japan, alright, pay, then I'll sleep by your side
            Bb               Gm       A                            Dm
Things are easy when you're big in Japan, oh when you're big in Japan
